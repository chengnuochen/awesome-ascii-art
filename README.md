The author of this paper also did [many interesting work](https://scut-mm.github.io/publications.html). 
3. [The Rotating Donut](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html): This is a interesting project by a1k0n. It is a tutorial about how to modeling and coding a rotating donut. I encountered this when watching Lex Fridman's Youtube Video. This hyperlink is from 
4. [dogflighZ](https://github.com/PointRider/open-java): a interesting ASCII Art flight game based on Java.
